The content you want to include: List specific sections (e.g., About Me, Projects, Contact) and the type of information or media (e.g., text, images, links) you plan to add.

    I'm making about me, projects, and contact. I've used a "dark blue" background very often in the past, and I recently learned how to make the image the background, so I've decided to make the website space themed. I enjoyed the concept of space when i was younger so I'll talk a little bit about that.

    I'll include a profile picture, and make a small photo of Earth to indicate the "home.png" to lead back to home page.

Features or styles you would like AI to generate: Specify any advanced layouts, animations, or design elements you want to explore with AI assistance (e.g., responsive design, hover effects, or creative color schemes).

    The Ai should include a space theme where all the text should float like there's no gravity
