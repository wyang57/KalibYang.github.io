Make sure it does not change the original index-manual.html, index-ai-revised.html, styles/hw1-styles.css and styles/hw1-styles-ai-revised.css.

Make sure it does not use any external libraries or packages, such as JavaScript frameworks or CSS frameworks. (Only vanilla HTML and CSS are allowed.)

    During my experience, for some reason copying relative path did not work so I had to copy the entire path for the majority of the code. I also had to rely on my notes for some portions like where to make image the background. I believe I succeeded with the visuals I wanted to convey. I tried making the sitemap the same but had some complications. I attempted to remake the background but that would've required a new styles so I ended up simply including the galaxy image as a normal visual in front and making the div box brighter. And the text light blue to match the galaxy color.

    The ai did not surpass my expectations, the animation that was added in the "revised" was fairly simple. The "creative" remake which I told it to be creative actually oversimplified the entire web page which I consider way less creative than the thought I put into my website, but it makes sense to an extent.
