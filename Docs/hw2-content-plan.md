For HW2, I will create a jungle-themed website. My last project had a space theme, but this time I want something more tangled, organic, and exploratory. I chose vines as the central visual because they represent how ideas grow messy but semi-organized. That metaphor fits the way I think and build.

I will use this jungle theme to showcase a list of my personal AI projects. Some of these Iâ€™ve already started, and others I plan to develop over time. The vines will visually represent how these projects are connected and evolving.

I will include a heading box at the top of the page to make it feel more like a real website since most sites have a clear title/banner at the top.

All major sections like intro, project cards, and contact form, will be wrapped in `<div>` containers to keep the layout neat and modular. This will help me control spacing, alignment, and styling more easily. It also makes the site feel more organized and intentional.

Each content block will be styled to match the jungle aesthetic using transparent background and centered alignment for all areas.

AI GENERATION TESTS

Based on my planning documents and jungle-themed concept, generate a complete AI version of my HW2 website using only vanilla HTML and CSS.

"Create the following files:

index-hw2-ai.html
projects-hw2-ai.html
contact-hw2-ai.html
styles/hw2-styles-ai.css

Follow my structure from hw2-content-plan.md, including the use of <div> containers for layout"

result 1:

the Home, Projects, and Contact pages look like they're all from the same page while mine feels like navigating into a different website. It chose a blurry theme for some reason where the div boxes are blurred. The organization looks much more neat, but the background for the boxes no longer exist, making the text more difficult to see.

There are now shadows and individual buttons navigating to even parts of a page. It seems minor but timeconsuming if I did it manually.

test 2: "You can update the 4 ai files again. make it clear and neat, and make it jungle themed. You can include animations."

it seemingly made minor changes. The text boxes have colored transparently. it claims it has made animation changes to the background but are not visible.

Test 3: "I don't see any animations. feel free to be creative, make things more obvious. Make the website interesting and cool in this forest vines theme"

There was a very minor update in animation. The title gets underlined with a light green line when the mouse hovers over it. It was the only change it created.

Test 4: "Be even more creative with the forest theme. you can change it up"

when opening each page the 3 projects grew to size individually seperate from the rest of the page. there also seems to be floating bubbles around the title area, but there aren't enough bubbles nor are they big enough to be very visually appealing. When I hover over each link it has an underline animation show, the underline is a gradient green. Also they added a "twilight" button that makes the title screen slightly tinted. I believe it was meant as a dark theme but it does not effect the rest of the page, making it seem miniscule.

Test 5: "Be even more creative with the forest theme. you can change it up"

The bubbles are larger and more wide spread as requested. When scrolling down the bubbles remain in place which breaks the immersion. The bubbles also reset in the same space each time I change the page, like it plays the same video loop.
