HW2 Reflection
Development Reflection (Manual Coding Experience)
For HW2, I chose a jungle theme to represent how ideas grow in tangled, organic ways. My strategy was to build each page manually using semantic HTML and organized div containers for layout control. I focused on clarity, accessibility, and thematic consistency across all pages. I used a heading box at the top of each page to anchor the layout and reinforce the site’s identity.

One challenge I faced was centering titles and div boxes. Sometimes they would reset or shift unexpectedly depending on screen size or browser behavior. I solved this by refining my CSS with margin auto, text-align center, and using flexbox for more reliable alignment. Another challenge was maintaining layout consistency as I added more elements. I learned to group related content into containers and apply consistent spacing and alignment rules, which made the site feel more intentional and easier to style.

I learned how to create structured header sections using flexbox and utility classes, which helped me organize navigation links and titles cleanly at the top of the page. I also learned how animations work and how to implement buttons that trigger visual changes, such as hover effects, transitions, and theme toggles. These additions made the site more interactive and polished.

AI Iterative Development Summary!!!!!!!
See docs/hw2-ai-iterations.md for full logs of each round.

My strategy was to use my planning documents to prompt AI to generate a jungle-themed site. The first two rounds followed my structure closely. Later rounds explored more creative directions, including animations, overlays, and thematic effects.

Across iterations, I noticed that AI often claimed visual changes that were either too subtle or not implemented. It responded better to specific visual prompts than abstract styling requests. For example, asking for “larger bubbles” or “gradient hover effects” produced better results than simply saying “make it more jungle-themed.”

The most significant breakthroughs came in Round 4 and Round 5. In Round 4, AI introduced animated project card growth and gradient hover effects. In Round 5, it expanded the bubble overlay and improved thematic consistency across pages. These changes added visual interest and helped unify the site’s aesthetic.

Comparative Analysis
My manual version had stronger jungle visuals and a more organized structure. The AI’s first version was cleaner in some ways, but it didn’t fully match the theme and needed help with accessibility and visual clarity.

As the AI version evolved, it became easier to navigate. Buttons were clearly placed, and the layout made it obvious where to click and how to move between sections. That was one of the strengths of the AI-generated structure, it handled navigation well and kept things consistent across pages.

Overall Reflection
Iterative improvement was far more effective than one-shot generation. Each round helped refine the theme, fix bugs, and push creativity. It also revealed AI’s limits, especially around visual fidelity and accessibility, and highlighted the importance of human oversight.

Compared to Assignment 1, HW2 was more challenging for AI. The space theme in Assignment 1 was easier to implement because it is a more common visual motif. I had also explicitly requested floating elements, which gave the AI clearer direction. In HW2, I did not specify animation types, which may have led to weaker results. I learned that AI collaboration works best when prompts are clear, visual, and directive.

In future projects, I plan to use AI for rapid prototyping and then refine manually for accessibility and polish. I will provide clear, visual prompts and test results live to verify claims. I will also document each iteration to track progress and justify design choices.
