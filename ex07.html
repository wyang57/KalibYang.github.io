        Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities... because it
        is the quality which guarantees all others. Courage is what it takes to
        stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and
        listen.

        The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, reaching a total
        body length of up to 3.3 metres (11 ft) and weighing up to 306 kg (670
        lb). It is the third largest land carnivore (behind only the Polar bear
        and the Brown bear). Its most recognizable feature is a pattern of dark
        vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with lighter underparts. It has
        exceptionally stout teeth, and the canines are the longest among living
        felids with a crown height of as much as 74.5 mm (2.93 in) or even 90 mm
        (3.5 in). In zoos, tigers have lived for 20 to 26 years, which also
        seems to be their longevity in the wild.[5] They are territorial and
        generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous
        areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled
        with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely
        populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.
        Tigers once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the
        eastern coast of Russia. Over the past 100 years, they have lost 93% of
        their historic range, and have been extirpated from southwest and
        central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of
        Southeast and Eastern Asia. Today, they range from the Siberian taiga to
        open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps. The remaining six tiger
        subspecies have been classified as endangered by IUCN. The global
        population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062 to 3,948
        individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th
        century,[6] with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets
        that are isolated from each other. Major reasons for population decline
        include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching.[1] The
        extent of area occupied by tigers is estimated at less than 1,184,911
        km2 (457,497 sq mi), a 41% decline from the area estimated in the
        mid-1990s.[7]
